In principle, this repository should include everything needed to reproduce the book from scratch. NB We have used the huxtable package to create the tables in the book. Unfortunately, recent releases of quarto (1.4+) have broken cross-referencing in huxtable, therefore use quarto version 1.3 to preserve cross-referencing.
