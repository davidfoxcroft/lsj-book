<table width="50%" border="1" ><caption>Table 9.2: A crude guide to understanding the relationship between statistical significance and
effect sizes. Basically, if you don’t have a significant result then the effect size is pretty meaningless because you
don’t have any evidence that it’s even real. On the other hand, if you do
have a significant effect but your effect size is small then there’s a pretty good chance that your
result (although real) isn’t all that interesting. However, this guide is very crude. It depends
a lot on what exactly you’re studying. Small effects can be of massive practical importance in
some situations. So don’t take this table too seriously. It’s a rough guide at best.</caption>
