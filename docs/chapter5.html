<h1> 5. Drawing graphs</h1>


<blockquote>
<em>Above all else show the data.</em> <br />
- Edward Tufte<a href="#note1">[1]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Visualising data is one of the most important tasks facing the data analyst. It’s important
for two distinct but closely related reasons. Firstly, there’s the matter of drawing “presentation
graphics”, displaying your data in a clean, visually appealing fashion makes it easier for your
reader to understand what you’re trying to tell them. Equally important, perhaps even more
important, is the fact that drawing graphs helps you to understand the data. To that end, it’s
important to draw “exploratory graphics” that help you learn about the data as you go about
analysing it. These points might seem pretty obvious but I cannot count the number of times
I’ve seen people forget them.
</p>

<p>
To give a sense of the importance of this chapter, I want to start with a classic illustration of
just how powerful a good graph can be. To that end, Figure 5.1 shows a redrawing of one of the
most famous data visualisations of all time. This is John Snow’s 1854 map of cholera deaths.
The map is elegant in its simplicity. In the background we have a street map which helps orient
the viewer. Over the top we see a large number of small dots, each one representing the location
of a cholera case. The larger symbols show the location of water pumps, labelled by name. Even
the most casual inspection of the graph makes it very clear that the source of the outbreak is
almost certainly the Broad Street pump. Upon viewing this graph Dr Snow arranged to have
the handle removed from the pump and ended the outbreak that had killed over 500 people.
Such is the power of a good data visualisation.
</p>

<p>
The goals in this chapter are twofold. First, to discuss several fairly standard graphs that
we use a lot when analysing and presenting data, and second to show you how to create these
graphs in jamovi. The graphs themselves tend to be pretty straightforward, so in one respect
this chapter is pretty simple. Where people usually struggle is learning how to produce graphs,
and especially learning how to produce good graphs. Fortunately, learning how to draw graphs
in jamovi is reasonably simple as long as you’re not too picky about what your graph looks like.
What I mean when I say this is that jamovi has a lot of very good default graphs, or plots, that
most of the time produce a clean, high-quality graphic. However, on those occasions when you
do want to do something non-standard, or if you need to make highly specific changes to the
figure, then the graphics functionality in jamovi is not yet capable of supporting advanced work
or detail editing.
</p>

the location of a cholera case and each large circle shows the location of a well. As the plot
makes clear, the cholera outbreak is centred very closely on the Broad St pump.

<h2> 5.1 Histograms</h2>


<p>
Let’s begin with the humble histogram. Histograms are one of the simplest and most useful
ways of visualising data. They make most sense when you have an interval or ratio scale
variable (e.g., the afl.margins data from Chapter 4) and what you want to do is get an overall
impression of the variable. Most of you probably know how histograms work, since they’re so
widely used, but for the sake of completeness I’ll describe them. All you do is divide up the
possible values into bins and then count the number of observations that fall within each bin.
This count is referred to as the frequency or density of the bin and is displayed as a vertical
bar. Ihe AFL winning margins data there are 33 games in which the winning margin was less
than 10 points and it is this fact that is represented by the height of the leftmost bar that we
showed earlier in Chapter 4, Figure 4.2. With these earlier graphs we used an advanced plotting
package in R which, for now, is beyond the capability of jamovi. But jamovi gets us close,
and drawing this histogram in jamovi is pretty straightforward. Open up the ‘plots’ options
under ‘Exploration’ - ‘Descriptives’ and click the ‘histogram’ check box, as in Figure 5.2. jamovi
defaults to labelling the y-axis as ‘density’ and the x-axis with the variable name. The bins
are selected automatically, and there is no scale, or count, information on the y-axis unlike the
previous Figure 4.2. But this does not matter too much because after all what we are really
interested in is our impression of the shape of the distribution: is it normally distributed or is
there a skew or kurtosis? Our first impressions of these characteristics come from drawing a
histogram.
</p>


<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 5.2: jamovi screen showing the histogram check box
</figcaption>
<img src="images/Figure23.PNG" alt="Figure 5.2" />
</figure>

<p>
One additional feature that jamovi provides is the ability to plot a ‘Density’ curve. You
can do this by clicking the ‘Density’ check box under the ‘Plots’ options (and unchecking ‘Histogram’), and this gives us the plot shown in Figure 5.3. A density plot visualises the distribution
of data over a continuous interval or time period. This chart is a variation of a histogram that
uses kernel smoothing to plot values, allowing for smoother distributions by smoothing out
the noise. The peaks of a density plot help display where values are concentrated over the interval. An advantage density plots have over histograms is that they are better at determining the
distribution shape because they’re not affected by the number of bins used (each bar used in a
typical histogram). A histogram comprising of only 4 bins wouldn’t produce a distinguishable enough shape of distribution as a 20-bin histogram would. However, with density plots, this
isn’t an issue.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
Although this image would need a lot of cleaning up in order to make a good presentation
graphic (i.e., one you’d include in a report), it nevertheless does a pretty good job of describing
the data. In fact, the big strength of a histogram or density plot is that (properly used) it does
show the entire spread of the data, so you can get a pretty good sense about what it looks like.
The downside to histograms is that they aren’t very compact. Unlike some of the other plots
I’ll talk about it’s hard to cram 20-30 histograms into a single image without overwhelming the
viewer. And of course, if your data are nominal scale then histograms are useless.
</p>


<h2> 5.2 Boxplots</h2>


<p>
Another alternative to histograms is a boxplot, sometimes called a “box and whiskers” plot.
Like histograms they’re most suited to interval or ratio scale data. The idea behind a boxplot
is to provide a simple visual depiction of the median, the interquartile range, and the range of
the data. And because they do so in a fairly compact way boxplots have become a very popular
statistical graphic, especially during the exploratory stage of data analysis when you’re trying to
understand the data yourself. Let’s have a look at how they work, again using the afl.margins
data as our example.
</p>

<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 5.4: A box plot of the afl.margins variable plotted in jamovi
</figcaption>
<img src="images/Figure25.PNG" alt="Figure 5.4" />
</figure>

<p>
The easiest way to describe what a boxplot looks like is just to draw one. Click on the
‘Box plot’ check box and you will get the plot shown on the lower right of Figure 5.4. jamovi
has drawn the most basic boxplot possible. When you look at this plot this is how you should
interpret it: the thick line in the middle of the box is the median; the box itself spans the
range from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile; and the “whiskers” go out to the most
extreme data point that doesn’t exceed a certain bound. By default, this value is 1.5 times the
interquartile range (IQR), calculated as 25th percentile - (1.5*IQR) for the lower boundary,
and 75th percentile + (1.5*IQR) for the upper boundary. Any observation whose value falls
outside this range is plotted as a circle or dot instead of being covered by the whiskers, and
is commonly referred to as an outlier. For our AFL margins data there are two observations
that fall outside this range, and these observations are plotted as dots (the upper boundary is
107, and looking over the data column in the spreadsheet there are two observations with values
higher than this, 108 and 116, so these are the dots).
</p>

<h3> 5.2.1 Violin plots</h3>



<figure>

plot and data points
</figcaption>
<img src="images/Figure26.PNG" alt="Figure 5.5" />
</figure>

<p>
A variation to the traditional box plot is the violin plot. Violin plots are similar to box
plots except that they also show the kernel probability density of the data at different values.
Typically, violin plots will include a marker for the median of the data and a box indicating the
interquartile range, as in standard box plots. In jamovi you can achieve this sort of functionality
by checking both the ‘Violin’ and the ’Box plot’ check boxes. See Figure 5.5, which also has the
‘Data’ check box turned on to show the actual data points on the plot. This does tend to make
the graph a bit too busy though, in my opinion. Clarity is simplicity, so in practice it might be
better to just use a simple box plot.
</p>


<h3> 5.2.2 Drawing multiple boxplots</h3>


One last thing. What if you want to draw multiple boxplots at once? Suppose, for instance, I
wanted separate boxplots showing the AFL margins not just for 2010 but for every year between
1987 and 2010. To do that the first thing we’ll have to do is find the data. These are stored in
the aflsmall2.csv file. So let’s load it into jamovi and see what is in it. You will see that it is
a pretty big data set. It contains 4296 games and the variables that we’re interested in. What
we want to do is have jamovi draw boxplots for the margin variable, but plotted separately for
each year. The way to do this is to move the year variable across into the ‘Split by’ box, as in
Figure 5.6

<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 5.6: jamovi screen shot showing the ‘Split by’ window
</figcaption>
<img src="images/Figure27.PNG" alt="Figure 5.6" />
</figure>

The result is shown in Figure 5.7. This version of the box plot, split by year, gives a sense
of why it’s sometimes useful to choose box plots instead of histograms. It’s possible to get a
good sense of what the data look like from year to year without getting overwhelmed with too
much detail. Now imagine what would have happened if I’d tried to cram 24 histograms into
this space: no chance at all that the reader is going to learn anything useful.

data set

<h3> 5.2.3 Using box plots to detect outliers</h3>

<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 5.9: the jamovi filter screen

<img src="images/Figure30.PNG" alt="Figure 5.9" />
</figure>


<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 5.10: Frequency table for ID showing the ID numbers for the two suspicious outliers: 14
and 134
</figcaption>
<img src="images/Figure31.PNG" alt="Figure 5.10" />
</figure>


<p>
Because the boxplot automatically separates out those observations that lie outside a certain
range, depicting them with a dot in jamovi, people often use them as an informal method
for detecting outliers: observations that are “suspiciously” distant from the rest of the data.
Here’s an example. Suppose that I’d drawn the boxplot for the AFL margins data and it came
up looking like Figure 5.8. It’s pretty clear that something funny is going on with two of the
observations. Apparently, there were two games in which the margin was over 300 points! That
doesn’t sound right to me. Now that I’ve become suspicious it’s time to look a bit more closely
at the data. In jamovi you can quickly find out which of these observations are suspicious and
then you can go back to the raw data to see if there has been a mistake in data entry. To do this
you need to set up a filter so that only those observations with values over a certain threshold
are included. In our example, the threshold is over 300, so that is the filter we will create. First,
click on the ‘Filters’ button at the top of the jamovi window, and then type ‘margin ą 300’ into
the filter field, as in Figure 5.9.
</p>




<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 5.8: A boxplot showing two very suspicious outliers!
</figcaption>
<img src="images/Figure29.PNG" alt="Figure 5.8" />
</figure>

<p>
This filter creates a new column in the spreadsheet view where only those observations that
pass the filter are included. One neat way to quickly identify which observations these are is to
tell jamovi to produce a ‘Frequency table’ (in the ‘Exploration’ - ‘Descriptives’ window) for the
ID variable (which must be a nominal variable otherwise the Frequency table is not produced).
In Figure 5.10 you can see that the ID values for the observations where the margin was over
300 are 14 and 134. These are suspicious cases, or observations, where you should go back to
the original data source to find out what is going on.
</p>

<p>
Usually you find that someone has just typed in the wrong number. Whilst this might seem
like a silly example, I should stress that this kind of thing actually happens a lot. Real world
data sets are often riddled with stupid errors, especially when someone had to type something
into a computer at some point. In fact, there’s actually a name for this phase of data analysis
and in practice it can take up a huge chunk of our time: data cleaning. It involves searching
for typing mistakes (“typos”), missing data and all sorts of other obnoxious errors in raw data
files.
</p>

<p>
For less extreme values, even if they are flagged in a a boxplot as outliers, the decision about
whether to include outliers or exclude them in any analysis depends heavily on why you think
the data look they way they do and what you want to use the data for. You really need to
exercise good judgement here. If the outlier looks legitimate to you, then keep it. In any case,
I’ll return to the topic again in Section 12.10.
</p>



<h2> 5.3 Bar graphs</h2>

<p>
Another form of graph that you often want to plot is the bar graph. Let’s use the afl.finalists
data set with the afl.finalists variable that I introduced in Section 4.1.6. What I want to
do is draw a bar graph that displays the number of finals that each team has played in over
the time spanned by the afl.finalists data set. There are lots of teams, but I am particularly
interested in just four: Brisbane, Carlton, Fremantle and Richmond. So the first step is to set
up a filter so just those four teams are included in the bar graph. This is straightforward in
jamovi and you can do it by using the ‘Filters’ function that we used previously. Open up the
‘Filters’ screen and type in the following:
</p>

afl.finalists == ‘Brisbane’ or afl.finalists == ‘Carlton’ </br>

or afl.finalists == ‘Fremantle’ or afl.finalists == ‘Richmond’ <a href="#note2">[2]</a>

<p>
When you have done this you will see, in the ‘Data’ view, that jamovi has filtered out all
values apart from those we have specified. Next, open up the ‘Exploration’ - ‘Descriptives’
window and click on the ‘Bar plot’ check box (remember to move the ‘afl.finalists’ variable
across into the ‘Variables’ box so that jamovi knows which variable to use). You should then
get a bar graph, something like that shown in Figure 5.11.
</p>

</figure>


<h2> 5.5 Summary</h2>


<p>
Perhaps I’m a simple minded person, but I love pictures. Every time I write a new scientific
paper one of the first things I do is sit down and think about what the pictures will be. In my
head an article is really just a sequence of pictures linked together by a story. All the rest of
it is just window dressing. What I’m really trying to say here is that the human visual system
is a very powerful data analysis tool. Give it the right kind of information and it will supply a
human reader with a massive amount of knowledge very quickly. Not for nothing do we have
the saying “a picture is worth a thousand words”. With that in mind, I think that this is one
of the most important chapters in the book. The topics covered were:
</p>


<ul>
<li>
Common plots. Much of the chapter was focused on standard graphs that statisticians like
to produce: histograms (Section 5.1), boxplots (Section 5.2) and bar graphs (Section 5.3)
</li>
<li>
Saving image files. Importantly, we also covered how to export your pictures (Section 5.4)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
One final thing to point out. Whilst jamovi produces some really neat default graphics,
editing the plots is currently not possible. For more advanced graphics and plotting capability
the packages available in R are much more powerful. One of the most popular graphics systems
is provided by the ggplot2 package (see http://ggplot2.org/), which is loosely based on “The
grammar of graphics” (Wilkinson, Wills, Rope, Norton, and Dubbs 2006). It’s not for novices.
You need to have a pretty good grasp of R before you can start using it, and even then it takes
a while to really get the hang of it. But when you’re ready it’s worth taking the time to teach
yourself, because it’s a much more powerful and cleaner system.
