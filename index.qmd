## Preface {.unnumbered}

This book is an adaptation of DJ Navarro (2018). Learning statistics with R: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners. (Version 0.6). [https://learningstatisticswithr.com/](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/).

The jamovi version of this book was first released in 2018, as version 0.65. Versions 0.70 and 0.75 were released in subsequent years with corrections and additions; details of the changes in earlier versions of the book can be found in the preface to version 0.75: [https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18124061/learning-statistics-with-jamovi-0.75.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18124061/learning-statistics-with-jamovi-0.75.pdf). In that time, many people have contacted us asking for a hard copy version of the book. To achieve this, and to preserve the open source attributes of the book and materials, we have worked with [Open Book Publishers](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/books/10.11647/obp.0333) in Cambridge, UK, to release this updated version. Open Book Publishers are the leading independent open access publisher of academic research in the Humanities and Social Sciences in the UK. They are award-winning, not-for-profit, run by scholars, and committed to making high-quality research freely available to readers around the world.
