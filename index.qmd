## Preface to Version 1.00 {.unnumbered}

This book is an adaptation of DJ Navarro (2018). Learning statistics with R: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners. (Version 0.6). [https://learningstatisticswithr.com/](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/).

The jamovi version of this book was first released in 2018, as version 0.65. Versions 0.70 and 0.75 were released in subsequent years with corrections and additions. In that time, many people have contacted us asking for a hard copy version of the book. To achieve this, and to preserve the open source attributes of the book and materials, we have worked with [Open Book Publishers](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/books/10.11647/obp.0333) in Cambridge, UK, to release this updated version. Open Book Publishers are the leading independent open access publisher of academic research in the Humanities and Social Sciences in the UK. They are award-winning, not-for-profit, run by scholars, and committed to making high-quality research freely available to readers around the world.
