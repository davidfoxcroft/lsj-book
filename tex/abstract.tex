{\bf Overview}
\end{center}

\noindent
{\it learning statistics with jamovi} covers the contents of an introductory statistics class, as typically taught to undergraduate psychology students. The book discusses how to get started in jamovi as well as giving an introduction to data manipulation. From a statistical perspective, the book discusses descriptive statistics and graphing first, followed by chapters on probability theory, sampling and estimation, and null hypothesis testing. After introducing the theory, the book covers the analysis of contingency tables, correlation, $t$-tests, regression, ANOVA and factor analysis. Bayesian statistics are covered at the end of the book.
